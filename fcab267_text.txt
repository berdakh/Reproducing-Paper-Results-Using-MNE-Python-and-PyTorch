Methods
Patient cohort
This was a retrospective cohort study. Children (below
age 21) with medically refractory epilepsy (typically with
monthly or greater seizure frequency and failure of more
than three first-line anti-seizure medications) who had
intracranial electrodes implanted for the planning of epilepsy surgery with anticipated cortical resection with the
Pediatric Epilepsy Program at UCLA were consecutively
recruited between August 2016 and August 2018.
Diagnostic stereo-EEG evaluation (not intended for resective surgery) was excluded (Table 1).

Subdural electrode placement
Macroelectrodes, including platinum grid electrodes
(10 mm intercontact distance) and depth electrodes (platinum, 5 mm intercontact distance), were surgically
implanted. The total number of electrode contacts in each
subject ranged from 40 to 128 (median 96 contacts). The
placement of intracranial electrodes was mainly guided by
the results of scalp video-EEG recording and neuroimaging
studies. All electrode plates were stitched to adjacent
plates, the edge of the dura mater, or both, to minimize
movement of subdural electrodes after placement.

Acquisition of three-dimensional
(3D) brain surface images
We obtained preoperative high-resolution 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo
(MPRAGE) T1-weighted image of the entire head. A
FreeSurfer-based 3D surface image was created with the
location of electrodes directly defined on the brain surface, using post-implant computed tomography (CT)
images.39 In addition, intraoperative pictures were taken
with a digital camera before dural closure to enhance
spatial accuracy of electrode localization on the 3D brain
surface. Upon re-exposure for resective surgery, we visually confirmed that the electrodes had not migrated compared to the digital photo obtained during the electrode
implantation surgery.

Intracranial EEG recording
Standard protocol approvals,
registrations and patient consents
The institutional review board at UCLA approved the use
of human subjects and waived the need for written
informed consent. All testing was deemed clinically relevant for patient care, and also all the retrospective EEG
data used for this study were de-identified before data extraction and analysis. This study was not a clinical trial,
and it was not registered in any public registry.

Patient evaluation
All children with medically refractory epilepsy referred
during the study period underwent a standardized presurgical evaluation, which—at a minimum—consisted of inpatient video-EEG monitoring, high resolution (3.0 T)
brain MRI and 18 fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET), with MRI-PET co-registration.26
The margins and extent of resections were determined
mainly based on seizure onset zone (SOZ), clinically
defined as regions initially exhibiting sustained rhythmic
waveforms at the onset of habitual seizures. In some
cases, the seizure onset zones were incompletely resected
to prevent an unacceptable neurological deficit.

Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording was obtained using
Nihon Kohden Systems (Neurofax 1100A, Irvine, CA,
USA). The study recording was acquired with a digital
sampling frequency of 2000 Hz, which defaults to a proprietary Nihon Kohden setting of a low frequency filter
of 0.016 Hz and a high frequency filter of 600 Hz at the
time of acquisition. For each subject, separate 10-min
and 90-min EEG segments from slow-wave sleep were
selected at least 2 h before or after seizures, before antiseizure medication tapering and before cortical stimulation mapping, which typically occurred 2 days after the
implant. All the study iEEG data were part of the clinical
EEG recording.

Automated detection of HFOs
A customized average reference was used for the HFO analysis, with the removal of electrodes containing significant
artefacts.26,28,40 Candidate interictal HFOs were identified
by an automated short-term energy detector (STE).41,42 This
detector considers HFOs as oscillatory events with at least
six peaks and a centre frequency occurring between 80 and
500 Hz. The root mean square (RMS) threshold was set at
five standard deviations (SD), and the peak threshold was
set at three SD. The HFO events are segments of EEG signals with durations ranging from 60 to 200 ms (see SI for

mitigate potential labelling errors, we then generalized
this approach to our central task of discovering eHFOs
by replacing experts’ inputs with inexact weak labels
implied by clinical outcomes and by using the ‘purification power’ of DL to automatically distill eHFOs.
Furthermore, (i) we proved the generalizability of this approach by using patient-wise cross-validation, implying a
DL algorithm trained by EEG data from a large and diverse enough retrospective cohort is likely applicable to
future patients; and (ii) we reverse engineered interpretable salient features of the DL-discovered eHFOs and
showed that they aligned with current expert knowledge.

duration distribution). We referred to these detected events
as candidate HFOs (c-HFOs).

Human expert classification of
HFOs
A human expert (HN: board certified in clinical neurophysiology and epilepsy, with experience in HFO analysis) classified c-HFOs in each patient’s 10-min EEG
segments into three classes: HFOs with spikes (spk-HFO),
HFOs without spikes (non-spk-HFO) and artefacts using
RippleLabs graphic user interface,42 based on three
images (unfiltered EEG tracing, filtered EEG tracing [80–

500 Hz] and time-frequency plot). Artefacts are false-positive events, including ringing (filtering of sharp transients),19 as well as muscle and background fluctuations
(see examples in Fig. 1). Another expert with similar
qualifications (SH) independently scored c-HFOs from
two representative patients, and inter-rater reliability was
examined using Cohen’s kappa statistics.

Supervised deep learning networks
using expert labels
The general workflow of the DL training and inference
were shown in the flowchart (Fig. 2).

Figure 1 Automated detection of HFOs and classification of HFOs by a human expert. After each EEG sample was arranged with a
referential montage, the short-term energy (STE) HFO detector was applied to detect candidate HFO events (A). The detected HFO events
were marked in the original tracing (B). Each detected HFO event was reviewed by a human expert to classify into HFO with spike (spk-HFO)
(C), HFO without spike (D), and artefacts: ringing artefact (E) and background noise (F). EEG ¼ electroencephalogram; HFOs ¼ high-frequency
oscillations; STE ¼ short-term energy.

Feature representation of c-HFOs
Each c-HFO was represented by a one-second window,
with the c-HFO was located at the centre (0 ms), and
including 500 ms of EEG signal before and after. To utilize the power of CNN, we captured the time-frequency
domain features as well as signal morphology information of the c-HFO window via three images (Fig. 3A).
The time-frequency plot (scalogram) was generated by
continuous Gabor Wavelets ranging from 10 Hz to
500 Hz.42 The EEG tracing plot was generated on a
2000  2000 image by scaling the time-series signal into
the 0–2000 range to represent the EEG waveform’s
morphology. The amplitude-coding plot was generated to
represent the relative amplitude of the time-series signal:
for every time point, the pixel intensity of a column of
the image represented the signal’s raw value at that time.
These three images were resized into the standard size
(224  224), serving as the input to the neural network.

Two-step deep learning model architecture
Given the expert labelling with three labels (artefacts,
spk-HFO and non-spk-HFO), the training of the deep
neural network (DNN) model was formulated as two
binary classification steps. Step 1 (artefact detector): we
differentiated between artefacts and ‘Real HFOs’, defined
as the union of spk-HFOs and non-spk-HFOs. All ‘Real
HFOs’ were labelled as the positive samples and the

artefacts were the negative samples. Step 2 (spk-HFO detector) classified the ‘Real HFOs’ into spk-HFO and nonspk-HFO; the spk-HFO were defined as positive samples,
and the non-spk-HFO were defined as negative samples.
The artefact detector and spike detector’s architectures
are identical and adapted from ResNet1843 with a modification in the last few layers to accommodate the binary
classification tasks. Specifically, the last layer of the
resnet18 was modified to be three fully connected layers
with LeakyReLU, BatchNorm and 10% dropout in between. The output of the model was fed into a sigmoid
function to bound the output between 0 and 1, representing the probability of each task. The input comprising
three image channels and the architecture of the networks
are shown in Fig. 3B. For the artefact detector, only the
time-frequency information was used. Hence time-frequency plots were repeated three times and concatenated
together as the input to the artefact detector. For the
spk-HFO detector, concatenation of the three feature-representing images (time-frequency plot, EEG tracing plot
and amplitude-coding plot) served as input.

Training and performance analysis
There were two types of training conducted: patient-wise
cross-validation and all-patients training. For patient-wise
cross-validation, one patient was selected at a time as the
test set, and the remaining patients were used for model

training. All events were pooled across the rest of the
patients, with 10% randomly sampled to serve as a validation set and the remaining 90% used for training. In
all-patients training, five-fold cross-validation was conducted across the pooled data across the full patient cohort. For each fold, 20% of the dataset was selected as
the test set, 70% was selected as the training set, and the
remaining 10% was used for validation.

Since the optimization goal of both detectors is binary
classification, we adopted binary cross-entropy as the loss
function and the Adam optimizer32 with a learning rate
of 0.0003. All of the training was conducted using 15
epochs (training iterations) and validation loss was plotted with respect to the number of epochs completed. For
the artefact detector, to improve generalization, we
picked the model in the epoch that corresponds to the

continuous Gabor Wavelets ranging from 10 Hz to 500 Hz. Middle: EEG tracing plot was generated on a 2000  2000 image by scaling the timeseries signal into the 0 to 2000 range. Right: amplitude-coding plot contains the amplitude at every time point; a column of the image represented
the signal’s actual value rescaled with a colour gradient. These three images were resized into 224  224 in order to fit into the neural network.
(B) CNN architecture. The architecture of the model was adapted from Resnet-18. The last layer of the resnet18 was modified to be three fullyconnected layers with LeakyReLU, BatchNorm and 10% dropout in between. The output of the model was fed into a sigmoid function to bound
the output between 0 and 1, representing the probability of each task. For task 2 (HFOs with spikes versus HFOs without spikes), the input
consisted of the three images (time-frequency plot, EEG tracing plot and amplitude-coding plot). Meanwhile, for task 1 (Real HFOs versus
artefacts), only the time-frequency plot information was found to be sufficient, and hence three same time-frequency plots were concatenated
together as the input of the model. EEG ¼ electroencephalogram; HFO ¼ high-frequency oscillation; CNN ¼ convolutional neural network.
